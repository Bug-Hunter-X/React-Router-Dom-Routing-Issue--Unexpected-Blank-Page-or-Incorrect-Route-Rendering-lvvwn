# React Router Dom Routing Issue
This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in React Router Dom v6 where routes fail to render correctly. The issue is characterized by unexpected blank pages or the persistence of the previous route's content when navigating.

## Bug Description
The application uses `react-router-dom` v6 to manage navigation.  When navigating between routes, sometimes the expected component does not render. Instead, a blank page may appear, or the content from the previous route may remain. This is inconsistent and occurs intermittently.

## Solution
The solution involves verifying the structure of the routes and addressing potential conflicts or missing components.
